# Hello, I'm John B!

## Intros
I'm beyond excited to have joined Clari! I spent the last 4 years at Apple working on Platform Engineering with a focus on CI/CD. I've worked for companies large and small and feel that Clari hits the sweet-spot.

I live in Oakland, CA, with my wife and two kiddos. Here's a [picture of the 4 of us](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FT3ve1Etz1qVqJfV8) at Joshua Tree back in May, 2022. 

## My Role
I manage the Developer Productivity team. Our mission is to provide the capabilities needed to build, test and deploy Clari's products. We offer reusable building blocks that allow Engineering teams to manage the quality and velocity with which they ship software.

## Preferences
* Slack > SMS > Email
* If its urgent, call my cel, anytime. After hours, please call twice.
* My Google Calendar is public to all Clari employees.
* I'm usually not available from 6:45am - 9:00am PST.

## 1:1's
If you report to me, these rules apply. For other 1:1's our mileage may vary.
* ***Your meeting, your time, your agenda.*** If I have items to discuss, I'll wait until the end or schedule a separate meeting.
* ***I'll take notes*** so you don't have to. We'll use Lattice for everything.
* ***You determine how often we meet*** and for how long. If you don't have an opinion, I'd suggest starting with 30 minutes per week.
* ***It's okay to skip*** or reschedule! Maybe you're focused on something else and don't want to loose momentum (flow!). Maybe your toe hurts. Or maybe you just feel like skipping. It's all good with me. If I have something to talk about I'll schedule time with you.
* The bottom line is ***I'm here for you*** and want to make the most of our time together.

## Office Hours / Coffee Time
I hold office hours everyday from 1:00 - 1:30pm PST. Here's the [Zoom link](https://clari.zoom.us/j/94942133775). Feel free to join if you'd like to chat about anything and everything. I'll be enjoying my post-lunch coffee and going through emails and Slack messages if no one shows up.
