## Intros
I'm beyond excited to have joined Clari! I spent the last 4 years at Apple working on Platform Engineering with a focus on CI/CD. I've worked for companies large and small and feel that Clari hits the sweet-spot.

## My Role
I manage the Developer Productivity team. Our mission is to provide the capabilities needed to build, test and deploy Clari's products. We offer reusable building blocks that allow Engineering teams to manage the quality and velocity with which they ship software.

## Values
* Autonomy with accountability
* Candor with compassion
* Default to open
* Trust but verify
* Have fun!

* I'm usually not available from 6:45am - 9:00am.
